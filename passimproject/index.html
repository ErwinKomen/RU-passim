                      The Latin sermons preached by the Fathers of the Early Church, Augustine, Jerome, Leo, Gregory and their contemporaries had an impact
                      that went far beyond the Late-Antique context in which they were first preached. Collections of patristic sermons traveled throughout the medieval world.
                      These sermons were not just preserved as relics of the authoritative voices of the early days of Christianity. On the contrary,
                      patristic sermons served a number of functions in the medieval religious experience and were changed and manipulated to fit their new purpose and context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This dynamic and enduring reception of the sermons of the Church Fathers can be traced in a vast corpus of medieval manuscripts.
                      <i>Patristic Sermons in the Middle Ages</i> will use a digital network of the manuscripts transmitting patristic sermon collections
                      to analyze for the first time the myriad ways in which patristic sermons were used in the Middle Ages and how the medieval adaptations
                      of the corpus of late-antique sermons reflect and steer both medieval and modern interpretations of the authorities of the Early Church.

                          PASSIM will study the medieval reception of the Latin sermons preached by the Early Church Fathers, using a digital network of manuscripts.
                        </p>
                        <p>The sermons of Augustine, Gregory the Great and other patristic preachers were transmitted throughout medieval Europe in the form of sermon collections, preserved in thousands of manuscripts. Nearly every manuscript contains a new combination of sermons, attesting to a continuous, widespread engagement with the authorities of the Early Church. The dynamic tradition of reorganising and rewriting the patristic heritage is largely overlooked by scholars of medieval religious practices, who concentrate on medieval preachers, and by scholars of Early Christianity, whose focus is the patristic context.</p>
                        <p>Medieval collections of patristic sermons were part of the liturgical life of the monastery, but also of an intellectual tradition. They offer unique insights into medieval attitudes toward authority, techniques of appropriation, church organisation, monastic networks and knowledge exchange. PASSIM will execute the first large-scale analysis of the formation and spread of patristic sermon collections in medieval Europe. The project will develop a digital network of manuscripts, using well-tried principles from the field of textual criticism. Building on this network, PASSIM will pursue three lines of inquiry: the customizing of standard liturgical collections as indicative of individual purposes and contexts, the impact of transmission on the popularity of patristic sermons, and pseudo-epigraphic sermons as revelatory of medieval perceptions of the Church Fathers.</p>
                        <p>PASSIM will bridge two disciplinary divides, between patristic and medieval sermon studies and between textual criticism and reception studies. Developing an interdisciplinary methodology with a wide applicability in the study of intellectual history, this project will introduce patristic preaching as a vibrant strand in the tapestry of the medieval religious tradition.</p>

                        <h4 style="text-align: center">Tracing the formation of Augustine’s authority in medieval sermon collections for the liturgy</h4>
                        <p>
                          Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the great authorities of the Early Church. His impact on western civilisation, during the Middle Ages in particular, cannot be overstated. Today, he is associated mainly with the Confessions and City of God, staples of the western canon. However, throughout the medieval period, his most widely disseminated works were his sermons.
                        </p>
                        <p>This project will investigate the development of Augustine’s authority and his formative role in medieval culture, not through the lens of the grand treatises that were admired by the intellectual elite, but through an analysis of the circulation, manipulation, and appropriation of his sermons, which were copied in hundreds of medieval manuscripts and read daily as part of the liturgy.</p>
                        <p>The anchor point will be the influential 8th-century sermon collection of Alanus of Farfa. Tracing its presence as part of a transnational European network of manuscripts, the project will investigate how the Augustinian nucleus in Alanus’ collection was customized in liturgical sermon collections from the 8th to the 15th century. This investigation will follow a key-thread in the tapestry of the medieval religious tradition, showing how ever-changing purposes and contexts determine the selection, alteration, and interpretation of the Augustinian heritage.</p>
                        <p>Overturning the traditional notion that medieval adaptations are a regrettable contamination of the antique original, this project will demonstrate that the dynamic medieval engagement with the authorities of Late Antiquity is the key to their perception then and now.</p>

                  <p>
                    PASSIM will develop a database of medieval manuscripts that preserve collections of patristic sermons. This database will go beyond a central repository for currently dispersed information. It will integrate the manuscripts in a digital network, which will calculate the probability of a connection between manuscripts and visualize transmission patterns.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The premise of the network is a logical principle used in textual criticism: manuscripts containing several of the same sermons ultimately derive their shared content from the same source. While nearly every manuscript contains a new combination of patristic sermons, it is not likely that a compiler had access to a different source manuscript for every sermon. The same source will have been used for several sermons in any given manuscript. This fact logically derives from the practical limitations of a pre-print society. The project will not construct a traditional stemma which reveals the genealogical relationships between manuscripts, but create a network of manuscripts to visualize the dissemination and impact of a sermon.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For every manuscript the database will contain: a detailed analysis of its content, structural features (e.g. capitula), date and place of origin (if known), provenance, bibliography, and links to digitized images (if applicable). The manuscripts will be identified based on current location, via drop-down menus. For every sermon the database will contain: incipit(s), explicit(s), attributed author(s), numbering(s) in different reference works (GRYSON, MACHIELSEN), keywords, manuscript witnesses, identification of the feast or period it is connected to in a liturgical context, whether it is part of pre-defined standard collections, indications of the existence of different versions of the sermon (because of common incipit, overlapping sections of text etc.).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The data needed to construct this network will be sourced from heuristic tools, manuscript catalogues both digital and in print (e.g. Bibl. nat. de France), relevant databases (IRHT Medium, Early medieval monasticism, ROME), studies on patristic sermon transmission and critical editions of the sermons of the Church Fathers, lists of manuscripts of patristic authors (e.g. HUWA, Mirabile, Traditio Patrum), Claves; critical editions of the sermons of the Church Fathers; case studies in the field’s major journals (e.g. Revue Bénédictine, Sacris Erudiri, Scriptorium). Incomplete information will be verified on the original manuscripts. The search interface will allow queries such as ‘in which manuscripts do sermons x, y, z occur together’, ‘which 12th-century manuscripts share content with manuscript y’ etc., with the results visualized in an interactive network of nodes and ties.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The database will be fully transparent in order to safeguard its scientific usability, providing overviews of all manuscripts, authors, and sermons introduced to date and all bibliographical sources mined for information.
