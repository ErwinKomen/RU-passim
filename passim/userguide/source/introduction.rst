Introduction
============

This document describes how to use the PASSIM (Patristic Sermons in the Middle Ages) Research Tool. The tool is made for researchers in the field of the transmission and reception of the Latin sermons preached by the Early Church Fathers:  Augustine of Hippo, Ambrose, Leo the Great, Gregory the Great and many of their contemporaries up to and including the Venerable Bede. 

Patristic sermons travelled in manuscript form throughout the medieval world. These sermon collections were not just copied as relics of the authoritative voices of the Early Church. They were reorganized, manipulated, rewritten and added to.

The PASSIM research tool makes it possible to search the sermons and manuscripts contained in the PASSIM database and to analyze the reception of patristic sermons in the Middle Ages on a large scale. And to illustrate how the medieval interpretation and recontextualization of late-antique sermons colored the perception of the Church Fathers then and now .

The PASSIM Research Tool was developed in the PASSIM Project (2019 â€“ 2024). This project was funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement No ERC-2018-stg 802210).
