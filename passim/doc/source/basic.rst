The 'basic' app
===============

The ``basic`` app makes three basic views available:

  ``BasicList`` view - built on Django's ``ListView``, comes with its own default template

  ``BasicDetails`` view - built on Django's ``DetailView``, comes with its own default templates (one for the edit part and one for the overal details)

  ``BasicPart`` view - extends Django's ``View``, without any default template (this is mainly used for Ajax POST communication)
