   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Basic Utilities
===============

This documentation explains how to use several of the Radboud University's Django **Basic Utilities**.
This includes the views ``BasicList``, ``BasicDetails`` and ``BasicPart``. 
But it also includes the ``tagtext`` app, facilitating searchable tags right in text.
And it includes the ``mapview`` app, which serves as an interface between 
a Django web application and a geographical map with locations important for one's data.
