Assumptions
===========

There are a few assumptions for using the ``BasicListView``:

1. The class using it must be inside ``views.py``
2. The class must define a few obligatory attributes
3. The template's default location is ``seeker/basic_list.html``
4. There must be a **DetailsView** using the same ``basic_name`` as the listview
