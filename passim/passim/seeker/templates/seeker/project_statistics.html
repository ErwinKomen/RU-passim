<div class="">
  Project {{project.name}} is associated with the following items:

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Manuscripts:</td>
        <td>{{count_m}}</td>

  </table>

  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  No items are allowed to be <i>without</i> a project assigned to them.
  Should an item turn out to be without a project (when you delete project [{{project.name}}] from that item,
  the project cannot be deleted from that item. 
  The proper way to 'clean' a whole project is:
  <ul>
    <li>Review all the items belonging to a particular project (manuscripts, sermons, authority files, historical collections) </li>
    <li>Choose:
      <ul>
        <li>Add the proper (alternative) project to that item, so that it won't be 'project-orphaned'</li>
        <li>Or remove the item (if you have the right), so that it won't have a chance to be 'project-orphaned'</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Only then is it possible to remove the project association from all these items</li>
  </ul>
</div>
